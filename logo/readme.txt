To those curious about the logo creation and files!
I used the minecrafter regular font making sure to respect the license
In blender I use the text object, with this font, and converted it to a mesh
I extruded the mesh arbitrarily, set up camera, lighting, materials, and voila
Then I used chrissimpkins/Crunch to compress the rendered files to save space
In short, that is how these files were created!
